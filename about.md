This is awfully outdated! I am currently an applied research scientist in natural language processing at ServiceNow / ElementAI. Reach me on LinkedIn!

Bonjour!

I am currently doing a professional master's degree in machine learning at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA). During my masters, I took classes on machine learning, deep learning, probabilisic graphical models, structured prediction, natural language processing and data science. I am mainly interested in the use of neural network approaches for natural language understanding. I am also interested in various applications of machine learning in science, art and design.

I am currently member of a discussion panel on the ethics of AI and how the field should be regulated. Our work focuses mainly on the use of data in the workplace and during the employment process.

Previously, I was an undergraduate in physics at the Université de Montréal. I took classes on various subjects in physics and computer science, such as quantum information, numerical modelisation in physics, statistical physics and data structures. 

Outside of work and school, I am also interested in basketball and sports in general, as well as philosophy, fashion and design.

Hope you'll like my little page!
