Bonjour!

I am an undergraduate in physics at the Université de Montréal. I am presently doing an internship in astrophysics, directed by Pierre Bergeron. I am working on developping a complete, statistically unbiased, volume-based sample of white-dwarf stars within a distance of 40pc of the sun. After my B.Sc., my objective is to complete an M.Sc. in informatics. I'm interested in machine learning and quantum computing as well. I'm still undecided about the subject of my M.Sc. Hope you'll like my little page!

Patrice
