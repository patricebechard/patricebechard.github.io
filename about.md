Bonjour!

I am an undergraduate in physics at the Université de Montréal. I am currently taking classes about various subjects in physics and computer science, such as quantum information, numerical modelisation in physics, statistical physics and data structures. After my B.Sc., my objective is to complete an M.Sc. in computer science. I'm interested in machine learning, network science and quantum computing as well. I'm still undecided about the subject of my M.Sc. Hope you'll like my little page!
