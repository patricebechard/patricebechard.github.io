During the Winter 2017 semester, I worked on a project on network science. I read multiple books and articles on the subject and I analyzed various real life networks from data I gathered. It was possible to map a part of the World Wide Web using a web crawler, similarly to the experiment conducted by [Albert et. al](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v401/n6749/abs/401130a0.html). I also mapped my Facebook friends network. Both types of networks analyzed presented scale-free network properties, as expected. Comparison between these networks and other real life networks was also conducted.
