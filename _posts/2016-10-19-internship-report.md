Between April and August 2016, I was an intern for the CRAQ (Centre de recherche en astrophysique du Québec) under the supervision of prof. Pierre Bergeron, at the Université de Montréal. I was working on developping a complete, statistically unbiased, volume-based sample of white-dwarf stars within a distance of 40pc of the sun, visible from the northern emisphere, as well as obtaining important physical properties for these stars, such as effective temperature, surface gravity (log g) and atmospheric composition.

The spectroscopic and photometric data used was mainly collected by Marie-Michele Limoges, PhD, who left the CRAQ after obtaining her diploma. She published a paper on the subject with Bergeron and prof. Sebastien Lepine from Georgia State University, available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.02297v1.pdf). The goal of my internship was to re-do the analysis of the whole sample using new atmospheric models for various spectral types of white dwarf stars and to clarify the codes and to make them more homogeneous and reusable.

White dwarf stars represent the last stage of the life of 97% of the stars of our Galaxy, including the Sun. The sample used is from the SUPERBLINK survey, a vast catalog containing proper motion data and photometric data of more than 2 million stars. White dwarf stars are stars having masses from about 0.4 to 1.4 times the mass of the sun. However, this type of star has a size comparable to the size of the earth, which means it is much more dense. In fact, the physics behind this type of star is pretty different from the one of a normal, main sequence star. For a main sequence star such as the Sun, the force that stops the star from collapsing onto itself from its own gravity is the pressure created by nuclear reactions in its core. A white dwarf star has no more nuclear reaction going on in its core, so it collapses onto itself, but that collapse is stopped by the pressure of the degenerate electrons of the core, which are governed by the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that fermions (the electrons in our case) cannot occupy the same quantum state. The star is then left in outer space, without doing anything except from cooling, for the rest of eternity.

I used two different methods to determine the atmospheric parameters of the various white dwarf stars. The first method used was the photometric method, which consists on using various photometric filters and to fit the temperature. This method has a flaw, because unless we have a trigonometric parallax measurement for the star, we have no choice but assume the log g of the star being 8.0 to fit the temperature photometrically. If we do have a trigonometric parallax measurement, we can fit both the effective temperature and the surface gravity of the white dwarf star. An example of a fit is demonstrated on a typical DA star, which is a white dwarf star showing hydrogen features only.

The other method used to find the physical parameters of a star is the so-called spectroscopic method. For this method, we use the spectrum of a star and we fit the log g and effective temperature using atmospheric models (a technique which was developped at the Université de Montréal). An example of a fit using the spectroscopic method is shown here on the same star as above.

DB stars, which show helium features, and DAZ stars, which show hydrogen features and metallic features as well, are fitted using the same techniques as described above. However, some type of white dwarf stars, such as DQ stars(carbon features)and DZ stars(metallic features) need to be fitted using a combination of both techniques.
