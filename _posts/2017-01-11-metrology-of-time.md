I did a research project about the way we measured time from ancient Egypt to today and how the various techniques used have evolved and how they changed the way we live. This was a really interesting subject to know more about and I think the resulting report is a great introduction to this particular subject and contains a lot of references if you are interested going further into it.

The document is in french. It is available in PDF format [Here](https://github.com/patricebechard/patricebechard.github.io/blob/master/_documents/metrologie_du_temps%20copy.pdf).
