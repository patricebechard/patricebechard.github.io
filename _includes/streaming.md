# 👋 About Me

I am an Applied Research Scientist at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/), where I focus on AI-driven workflow generation and business process automation for [Flow Designer](https://www.servicenow.com/products/platform-flow-designer.html). More broadly, I work on improving tools used to build enterprise workflows using advanced natural language processing, large language models, and information retrieval techniques.

Before this, I worked on improving enterprise specific language models to improve intent classification and [automating issue resolution for enterprise IT](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/washingtondc-servicenow-platform/page/administer/virtual-agent/concept/auto-resolution-va.html). My role involved training and deploying language models on real-world enterprise data, helping organizations resolve issues more efficiently.

Prior to ServiceNow, I was a Data Scientist at [Intact Financial Corporation](https://www.intact.com/en/), (the largest insurance company in Canada), where I specialized in NLP for insurance applications. I worked on building conversational agents for call centers, analyzing call topics with language models, and applying deep learning techniques to the telematics domain.

## 🎓🤖🪐 Education

I hold a Master’s in Machine Learning from [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/), and a Bachelor’s in Physics from [Université de Montréal](https://phys.umontreal.ca/english/home/). Along the way, I’ve also worked as a teaching assistant in special relativity, and briefly contributed to astrophysics research at [Astrophysics Research Center of Quebec (CRAQ)](https://craq-astro.ca/?lang=en).

## 🏃🍕🍷 Hobbies

Outside of work, I’m passionate about running, hiking, and exploring new restaurants, breweries, and wineries. I love classic design, natural wine, and pairing great food with good company. I’m fluent in French and English, enjoy practicing Spanish, and am always keen to learn something new, whether it’s in AI, cooking, or the great outdoors.
