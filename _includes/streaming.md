# 🌟 **Patrice Bechard: Trailblazer in AI, Physics, and the Sweet Science of Workflow** 🌟  

Let’s start with the basics: I’m a data nerd with a heart of geek. Born and raised in Quebec, I’ve spent my life chasing curiosity—first through the stars, then through data, and now through the amidst chaos of language models. Call me *Dr. Lab Rat* (well, M.Sc. rat, technically).  

## **The Physics Phase → ML Switch-Up**  
In my undergrad at Université de Montréal, I fell headfirst into physics—special relativity, astrophysics, you name it. (Yeah, I *still* love debates about time dilation at parties.) But then came the quantum leap: during a research stint at the Astrophysics Research Center, I stumbled into coding with Python and machine learning. Suddenly, instead of studying white dwarfs, I was building tools to map them. Fun fact: I once spent a wild summer night at the Mont-Mégantic Observatory hunting for stars and realizing I needed more sleep.  

## **AI to the Rescue: Insurance, Chatbots, and Dragons’ Den Wins**  
My career began at Intact Financial, where I transformed call center chaos into *BERT flavoured order*. Think: teaching machines to spot angry customers’ voices, build insurance chatbots that actually work, and even organizing “blind dates” for coworkers during the pandemic to boost morale (yes, I won two Dragons’ Den awards for that—it’s a miracle). The highlight? Proving to skeptics that AI isn’t just hype but a tool that can **literally** bridge people to the right solutions—whether it’s a customer’s invoice or a team-building date gone wrong.  

## **The ServiceNow Era: LLMs as Your Workflow BFF**  
Now at ServiceNow, I’m the science lead for something groundbreaking: teaching LLMs to generate workflows for low-code platforms. Ever tried training a model to turn a text request into a fully functioning IT ticket? It’s like coaching a toddler to do calculus… but with GPUs. My secret weapon? A pipeline to generate synthetic workflow data, and a **supercharged evaluation framework** that cuts testing time from days to hours (thanks, parallel processing!). Oh, and I’ve taught tools to “read” images and code, too—because why not let the robots do the heavy lifting?  

## **The Nerd in Me**  
I’m a stack of contradictions: fluent in French, English, and *Python*, but a mess at ordering croissants in another language. I code meticulously but skydive on weekends (they call it “statistical adrenaline management”). You’ll find me debugging a PyTorch model by day, then debating wine pairings or shooting hoops by night. (Coffee is my fourth language; don’t even ask about my espresso dataSize.ipynb.)*  

## **Proud of:**  
- Building tools that turn *”I need a refund”* into *”Here’s your $20 back”* (via NLP magic).  
- That time I taught a neural Turing machine to copy text flawlessly—after watching it fail 100 times.  
- Never giving up on collaborative filtering for coworker blind dates… it brought two people together!  

## **The Bottom Line?**  
I’m the guy who believes AI should **serve humanity**, not just profit motives. Whether it’s automating incident resolution for IT or making robots understand Quebecois accents, my mission’s clear: make tech feel a little more human.  

P.S. Ask me about my favorite PostgreSQL query or the worst data viz mistake I’ve ever made. Spoiler: It involved a rainbow pie chart and tears. 🥧🔥
