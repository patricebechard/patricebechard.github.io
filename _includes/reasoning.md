Alright, time to put together a bio that really captures who I am—professionally and personally. Let’s break this down step by step and make sure I highlight what matters most.

First, I want to set the scene with my current role at ServiceNow. It’s important to mention that I’m an Applied Research Scientist working on workflow generation and automation for Flow Designer. This isn’t just about coding; it’s about leading projects that blend cutting-edge AI (think language models, information retrieval, RAG) with real-world impact for enterprise workflows. I should also keep the tone accessible—no one likes a wall of jargon. I should also emphasize that this is not simply about applying existing tools to new problems, but to push the boundaries and invent new techniques to solve real-world problems.

Before ServiceNow, there’s a strong thread of applied NLP work. My stint working on language models focusing on intent classification and automating incident resolution, really shows I can take enterprise challenges and tackle them with practical machine learning solutions. That deserves a mention—maybe even a short anecdote or two about improving IT support through AI.

Going further back, my time at Intact Financial is key. Here, it’s all about NLP for insurance—chatbots for call centers, deep learning for telematics, and rolling up my sleeves with big data using PySpark and Hive. I want to make clear that this was more than theory: I built tools that helped real people and businesses, from data visualization for clients to interpretable ML methods. That versatility matters.

On the education side, my master’s at MILA in Machine Learning and my undergrad in Physics at Université de Montréal give me a solid foundation. Maybe I can highlight some hands-on projects—implementing neural nets from scratch, or that census of white dwarfs during my research assistant days. Even the teaching assistant gig in relativity deserves a nod; it shows I can explain tough concepts, not just crunch numbers.

Now, for the human side—because no one’s just their resume. I’ll talk about my hobbies: running, hiking, discovering new food, breweries, and natural wines. It’s also worth sneaking in my love of design, languages (French, English, a bit of Spanish), and that itch to always be learning.

I’ll round out the bio by pointing people to my Google Scholar, and wrap up with a friendly, approachable tone that shows both expertise and personality. The end goal is to give readers a sense of my journey, what drives me, and the things I care about beyond just work.

Alright—let’s weave these threads together and tell my story!
